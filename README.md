## Project Setup

2. Install dependencies for package.json files for server (in root of project) and for client (in "client" folder)

```bash
npm install
cd client && npm install
```

3. Run dev script in project root to run both server and client scripts simultaneously.

- Note: Make sure you are not in the "client" folder

```bash
npm run dev
```
